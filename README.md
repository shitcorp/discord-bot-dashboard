## About the project

coming soon...

## Using the dashboard
To use the dashboard, we recommend to follow the [starters guide](https://github.com/julianYaman/discord-bot-dashboard/blob/master/docs/GET_STARTED.md).
=======
**Vuetify Material Dashboard** is a beautiful resource built over [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/installation.html) and [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/). It will help you get started developing dashboards in no time. Vuetify Material Dashboard is the official Vuejs version of the Original [Material Dashboard PRO](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard). Using the Dashboard is pretty simple but requires basic knowledge of Javascript, [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/).

We have created it thinking about things you actually need in a dashboard. **Vuetify Material Dashboard**  contains handpicked and optimized Vuejs plugins. Everything is designed to fit with one another. As you will be able to see, the dashboard you can access on [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com) is a customization of this product.

**Vuetify** is developed exactly according to Material Design spec. Every component is handcrafted to bring you the best possible UI tools to your next great app. The development doesn't stop at the core components outlined in Google's spec. Through the support of community members and sponsors, additional components will be designed and made available for everyone to enjoy.

**Vuex** is a state management pattern + library for **Vue.js** applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vue's official devtools extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export/import.

Let us know what you think and what we can improve below. And good luck with development!

## Getting Started
- Install Nodejs from [Nodejs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open your terminal
- Navigate to the project
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` if you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn serve` to start a local development server
- A new tab will be opened in your browser

You can also run additional npm tasks such as
- `npm run build` to build your app for production
- `npm run lint` to run linting.

## Vue-cli

We used the latest 3.x [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) which aims to reduce project configuration
to as little as possible. Almost everything is inside `package.json` + some other related files such as
`.babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js` and `.postcssrc.js`.
